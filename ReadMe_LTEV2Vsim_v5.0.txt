**** This zip includes **** 
- The file "CopyrightNotice.pdf"
- Two scripts to run example simulations: "Simulations.m" and "Simulations_SpeedTest.m"
- The main of the simulator, which is the file "LTEV2Vsim.m", version 5.0;
- All the functions of the simulator organized in subfolders;
- The folder "ConfigFiles" with some example configuration files;
- The folder "TrafficTraces" including some traffic traces;
- The file "LTEV2Vsim Table of input parameters v5.0.pdf" detailing all the parameters of the simulator in this version.


**** How to run the first simulation? **** 
Like in previous versions, simply open "Simulations.m" and press play.


**** Version 5.0 main points **** 
Code has been reorganized and refactored.

Differently from previous versions, now the main is the same for both LTE-V2X and IEEE 802.11p.

LTE-V2X is on a per subframe basis and the Mode 4 algorithm is implemented as resource allocation algorithm number 18.
LTE-V2X Mode 4 and IEEE 802.11p have been widely tested in this version. Some LTE-V2X Mode 3 algorithms are also derived from previous versions, but they have not been tested in version 5.0.

The output "distance_details" has been removed.
It has been replaced by "packet_reception_ratio". The file looks similar. However, there is a significant difference: the first column now is the distance and not the awareness range, thus what included in the other columns is not anymore the cumulative of correct receptions, losses, etc., but the number of events at that distance. The last column is thus the error rate at the distance indicated in the same row, first column.

The new "data age" output has been added.
The data age is the time difference between the instant when the last correctly received message was generated by a given node and the instant a new message is received from the same transmitter. The DA implicitly takes into account the access delay and the correlation among errors.
