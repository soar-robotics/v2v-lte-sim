**** How to run the first simulation? **** 
Like in previous versions, simply open "Simulations.m" and press play.


**** Version 5.4 main points compared to version 5.0 **** 
Code has been reorganized and refactored.

Several parameters have been added (e.g., it is now possible to fix the power density in 
LTE instead of the transmitted power, to change the congestion parameters of ITS-G5, etc.) â€“ Please refer to the file "LTEV2Vsim Table of input parameters v5.4.pdf" for all the available parameters. The outputs have been revised. Some have been added (e.g., about CBR).The highway and Manhattan urban scenarios which are often used in ETSI and 3GPP documents have been added.The average SINR calculation has been revised, as detailed in "Notes_on_LTEV2Vsim_v5.4.pdf".Packet generation is not anymore necessarily periodic and an optional function has been implemented which automatically calculates the packet generation based on the vehicle speed as follows from the CAM triggering rules defined by ETSI.
The LTE allocation process has been improved with the new packet generation (details in "Notes_on_LTEV2Vsim_v5.4.pdf").
The packet acquisition phase has been revised in ITS-G5; now, the receiver tracks and decodes the stronger signal within 4us, which is compliant with what most devices do.
CBR and DCC are now implemented for both technologies following the ETSI rules (details in "Notes_on_LTEV2Vsim_v5.4.pdf")



**** Version 5.0 main points compared to version 3.5b **** 
Code has been reorganized and refactored.

Differently from previous versions, now the main is the same for both LTE-V2X and IEEE 802.11p.

LTE-V2X is on a per subframe basis and the Mode 4 algorithm is implemented as resource allocation algorithm number 18.
LTE-V2X Mode 4 and IEEE 802.11p have been widely tested in this version. Some LTE-V2X Mode 3 algorithms are also derived from previous versions, but they have not been tested in version 5.0.

The output "distance_details" has been removed.
It has been replaced by "packet_reception_ratio". The file looks similar. However, there is a significant difference: the first column now is the distance and not the awareness range, thus what included in the other columns is not anymore the cumulative of correct receptions, losses, etc., but the number of events at that distance. The last column is thus the error rate at the distance indicated in the same row, first column.

The new "data age" output has been added.
The data age is the time difference between the instant when the last correctly received message was generated by a given node and the instant a new message is received from the same transmitter. The DA implicitly takes into account the access delay and the correlation among errors.
